SpringMVCTest
=============

A small Spring MVC app to try out mvc test framework. Uses Spring 3.2.RC2  , Spring MVC Test, Jackson 2 , Gradle as core components. Spring MVC Test got integrated into test module in RC1 but RC2 is out so I am using that. I wanted to 
test out this style of testing so I created this project.
